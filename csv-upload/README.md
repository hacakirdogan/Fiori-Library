## csv-upload

A sample Fiori application for uploading CSV files via the SAPUI5 FileUploader component.

### Note

As of SAP UI5 version 1.103, the DOM event is no longer valid to upload files to a UI5 application. The sap.ui.unified.FileUploader.getFocusDomRef protected API shouldn't by used at application side. (See: https://me.sap.com/notes/0003217985)
